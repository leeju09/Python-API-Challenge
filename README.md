# Python-API-Challenge

Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So let's take what you've learned about python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may thinking: "That's obvious. It gets hotter." But if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?


# Some skills demonstrated for this challenge

*Make get requests with the Request library.

*Convert JSON into a Python dictionary.

*Read and apply API documentation.

*use an API key

*Create applications with your knowledge of Python and an APIâ€™s documentation.

*Load JSON from API responses into a Pandas DataFrame.

*Use the Geoapify/openweathermap API to obtain information about geographic areas.

#Requirements

#The requirements for "Part 1: WeatherPy" are the following

Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude (30 points)
Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the started code (10 points)

Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Temperature (5 points)

Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Humidity (5 points)

Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Cloudiness (5 points)

Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Wind Speed (5 points)

Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship (40 points)
Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude (5 points)

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude (5 points)

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude (5 points)

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude (5 points)

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude (5 points)

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude (5 points)

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude (5 points)

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude (5 points)

#The requirements for "Part 2: VacationPy" are the following (30 points)

Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame (5 points)

Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition (5 points)

For each city in the hotel_df DataFrame, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates (10 points)

Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map. (10 points)
